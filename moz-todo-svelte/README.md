## Project Structure

## DOM Operations

This project demonstrates efficient DOM operations using Svelte's compile-time approach:

- Uses Svelte's compile-time reactivity to generate minimal, efficient JavaScript
- No virtual DOM overhead - Svelte directly manipulates the DOM when state changes
- Implements smooth transitions and animations for adding/removing tasks
- Tracks and displays performance metrics for initial render and updates
