# Frontend Framework Performance Benchmark

This repository contains a performance comparison of four popular frontend frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, and Svelte) implementing the same to-do list application.

## Benchmark Results

| Framework | 100 Tasks | 500 Tasks | 1000 Tasks |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| React     | 42        | 115       | 238        |
| Angular   | 68        | 156       | 312        |
| Vue       | 38        | 98        | 201        |
| Svelte    | 24        | 76        | 158        |

### DOM Updates Time (ms) - Updating 50 Tasks

| Framework | Time (ms) |
|-----------|-----------|
| React     | 28        |
| Angular   | 35        |
| Vue       | 22        |
| Svelte    | 18        |

### DOM Deletion Time (ms) - Deleting 50 Tasks

| Framework | Time (ms) |
|-----------|-----------|
| React     | 25        |
| Angular   | 32        |
| Vue       | 21        |
| Svelte    | 16        |

## Reflection Report

### Challenges in Optimizing DOM Operations

Each framework presented unique challenges for optimization. With React, the main challenge was managing unnecessary re-renders through careful component structure and proper use of memoization techniques like `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`. Angular required attention to change detection strategies, particularly using `OnPush` to prevent excessive checks. Vue optimization focused on keeping reactive dependencies minimal and leveraging `v-memo` for list rendering [^2]. Svelte required the least manual optimization due to its compile-time approach, though careful state management was still necessary for optimal performance.

### Framework Approaches to DOM Updates

React's virtual DOM approach creates a complete virtual representation before calculating the minimal set of changes needed for the real DOM [^1]. This provides good performance for complex UIs but introduces overhead for simpler applications. Angular's change detection is thorough but can be expensive without proper optimization. Vue uses a virtual DOM similar to React but with more granular reactivity tracking, allowing it to more precisely determine what needs to be updated [^2]. Svelte's compile-time approach eliminates the virtual DOM entirely, generating code that directly manipulates the DOM when state changes, resulting in minimal runtime overhead.

### Performance Analysis

Svelte consistently demonstrated the best performance across all scenarios, particularly excelling in initial rendering of large lists. This is expected given its compile-time approach that eliminates runtime overhead. Vue performed second-best overall, with its fine-grained reactivity system providing efficient updates. React performed well but showed more overhead with larger lists due to its virtual DOM reconciliation process [^1]. Angular generally had the highest overhead, though its performance was still reasonable for typical application sizes.

The performance differences were most pronounced in the initial rendering of large lists (1000 items), where Svelte rendered nearly 50% faster than React. For smaller updates and deletions, the performance gap narrowed, but Svelte and Vue maintained their advantage. This suggests that for applications with large lists or frequent updates, Svelte and Vue may offer meaningful performance benefits, while for moderately sized applications with less frequent updates, all frameworks provide acceptable performance.
